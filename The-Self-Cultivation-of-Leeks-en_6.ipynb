   "## 6. The fundamental reason why “leeks” lack manners…\n",
   "\n",
   "Because “leeks” believe that they are playing a “zero-sum game”, as soon as they enter the market they almost turn into a different species. Observe carefully, as this description has no trace of a joke:\n",
   "\n",
   "> Shorts (sellers) and longs (buyers) brush past each other, each silently calling the other a dumbass.\n",
   "\n",
   "Why are they destined to call each other “dumbasses”? It’s a zero-sum game, so:\n",
   "\n",
   "> - One of the two has to be a dumbass;\n",
   "> \n",
   "> - I’m this smart, so the dumbass can only be you!\n",
   "> \n",
   "**All manners and cultivation at their core are the result of deep thought, and have nothing to do with the use or non-use of dirty language** — just as we discovered before that using the presence of or lack of study as a more precise way to distinguish between speculators and investors.\n",
   "\n",
   "If someone thinks incorrectly, or if the direction of their thought is incorrect, then in an instant they will truly become a vulgar person. People who participate in truly zero-sum games depend on “I am stronger than my opponent”. If they win they can do whatever they want, but “if they lose they’ve got to admit defeat”. However, those who treat non-zero-sum games as zero-sum games have no idea that they’ve made a mistake from the start, so their end can almost only be like this:\n",
   "\n",
   "> - Originally they had a 50% chance of winning;\n",
   "> \n",
   "> - But they misunderstood, so their chance of losing goes way up;\n",
   "> \n",
   "> - Their explanation for winning or losing is completely wrong;\n",
   "> \n",
   "> - Their explanation was wrong, so their next judgement will be wrong;\n",
   "> \n",
   "> - Then their chances of winning or losing the next time are also warped;\n",
   "> \n",
   "> - The so-called fate of leeks is cast in this way;\n",
   "> \n",
   "> - Therefore, in the end leeks all become full of complaints — complaints that they have produced for themselves…\n",

   "What is the truth?\n",

   "Transactions are always completed by two parties. Even if a buyer wants to buy, they can’t buy if there is no seller, no matter what the price is. Conversely, sellers are the same, they can’t sell if there are no buyers, no matter what the price is.\n",
   "\n",
   "At any given time, if traders have completely identical thinking, judgement, needs, and conclusions, it is impossible for there to be a trade. **At their core, all trades are the result of differences in thinking.** That is to say, traders must find someone who has different or even opposite conclusions in order to complete a trade, or else all they can do is “hang out their order”, and wait for someone with different conclusions to come along.\n",
   "\n",
   "So once a trade is completed, it makes sense that both parties should be grateful to each other. Why are they trading insults? Even if they’re not grateful, they should at least say thank you, right? So people who think deeply have a natural and sincere politeness:\n",
   "\n",
   "> Shorts (sellers) and longs (buyers) brush past each other and **wish each other all the best**.\n",
   "\n",
   "We all live in such a beautiful world, but just because of one small misstep leeks live in a dark corner that they have created for themselves. It’s quite a spectacle!\n",
   "\n",
   "A psychologist came to this conclusion in a paper: there are no bad people in this world, only *good* people, *stupid* people and *sick* people. In my view, a lot of sickness comes from stupidity. Back when I read this paper, all of a sudden I felt that the world had “become” brighter!\n",
